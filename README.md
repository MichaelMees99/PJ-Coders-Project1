Welcome to PJ Books!
"Find books fast, and save them for later!"

Description:

PJ Books is a website that allows the user to look up their favorite books, view a summary of a title, and save the book for later. There's even a map that can be used to find bookstores!
This site utilizes PureCss, Google Books API, Google Maps API, and JQUERY to make this possible.
